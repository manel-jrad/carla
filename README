Saving images to disk
Now you can stop the client script and relaunch it with different options. For instance now we are going to save to disk the images of the two cameras that the client attaches to the vehicle

client_example.py --autopilot --images-to-disk -c photo

CarlaUE4.exe HDMaps/Town07 -carla-server -benchmark -fps=15 -windowed -ResX=800 -ResY=600
conda activate python37
manual_control.py -a --filter Toyota
